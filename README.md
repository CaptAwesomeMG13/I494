My Biography
My name is Mitchell Gilchrist and I am a senior this year. My minor is in game design and I am the president of two clubs here on campus. Both of them are for esport. The first is for Valorant and the second is for Rocket League. My favorite color is red but I am slightly color blind so it can be hard to find the right color red when they all look the same. If you couldn't tell by the two team, I like to play video games and that has been super useful to keep up with people during this pandemic. Speaking of the pandemic, I hope our app that we develope can help influence some change and help things get back to normal sooner. I think that is all for this biography. Thank you, Mitchell Gilchrist
